How To Play:
Tetris game works with full functionality. On launching the website, you will be prompted a login page, with a register option.
After logging in, you will be met with a home page with a fancy button that sends you to the tetris page where you can play, also, there
is a header to easily navigate between the pages, or log out when you are done playing.

The tetris page allows you to play, with all functionalities including an audio track, and an up arrow key to turn the currentBlock in the
game. A current score calculates as the game is played. When you are prompted the 'Game Over' pop up, you are able to insert your score 
and send it to the leaderboard.

The leaderboard displays the top 5 users with the highest score in descending order with full functionality. Only users who chose to display 
their scores in the registrations will be able to see their score!

You can log out when you are finished. ENJOY!

Challenges:
- The score was not able to automatically update because I used php. I struggled for many hours and tried JQuery, AJAX, and even PHP through Javascript.
